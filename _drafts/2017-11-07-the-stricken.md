# The Beginning Times

In the beginning information was created that was written in a strange writing. As rulers came and gone, this writing was hidden in the farthest reaches of the planet. Never seeing light. Analytical inteligence was gaining favor on this planet, knowing when, what and how was important. **It was Sought after** hunted for, all highly evolved life on planet D-456 was in a war. Too get their hands on better, stronger, faster A.I than the other life.....yet no one knew what was in store for them....

## The Tale Of Intelligence

Long ago...before D-456 was considered even a planet by the federation counsel, **|or|** habited by any life form let alone an entire colony. A sole loner spotted D-456 as the perfect place to leave a present for future beings. Thinking well ahead of anyone this loner left this cryptic message in a mod-node. The loner had a gut feeling this would save him one day.........

### D-456 Year 3535.1.45.32 Alpha Tango

Three thousand five hundred thirty five years in **version** one, patch fourty five, minor thirty two. The group _Alpha Tango_ after fighting off the _zorbs_ in a bloody, yet short 5 year battle gained their freedom. _Alpha Tango_ even pushed the _zorbs_ all the way back to _Trinug Aaln_. The battle echoed acrossed the globe **change**, the _zorbs_ lost due to being over trusting in what worked in the past. While the _Alpha Tangos_ Thirst for knowledge grew and they thought and reserved themselves. Believing if they acted like fools for a short 10 to 15 years they could dominate over all. So they did and they watched as the _Zorbs_ helped them  conquer the world in the _Alpha Tangos_ quest not for world domination but **universal domination**!... to be continued.

### The Coming of Dawn

A red circle flares up and out of three groups are pushed out. _Sneebs_, an _Alpha Tangos_, and a _zorbs_ cast from the _galaxy of a nibble_. Thrown out for acts of hipocracy and other junk...or something who cares. _Sneebs_, small and quick started to stealthliley take over land, and start to build their amass of fortune on D-456 quickly. _Alpha Tangos_ split into two different groups, one group _Alpha Tango Sigma_ took to the mountains while _Alpha Tango Delta_ headed to caves. As for _zorbs_, they began spreading all over D-456 fighting amongst themselves and the other groups. They were an aimless, nonsensical, group who lacked any knowledge other than _divide and conquer_. As D-456 became more filled, it became harder to find things to trade. Although, around this time a huge __rift in time_ hit the _galaxy of byte_ and hit D-456 almost splitting it in half. D-456, became an evolution experiment from that day on. The half who were on the rift side evolved to superior beings and started to learn. While there counter parts became enemies, fighting, battling for dominance of the land. That created a new timeline,  the higher level _zorbs_, _Alpha Tangos_, and _sneebs_ joined forces. While the others stayed in there packs fighting not only each other but now the higher order. In the era called **1.0-RE**.
