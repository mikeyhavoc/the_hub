# Divine Touchdowns

> We can choose to see everything or... just what we like. What would you prefer?

As my heart pounds harder I wake up in a sweat! Screaming, I almost jump out of my bed!

> What is going on in there? - yells the nurse!

> We heard voices! who is here?! What is the commotion?! - the other children wanted to know.

Calmly I shrugged it off, I am fine. I told them... just a nightmare; Please do not worry, I said. My lord I thought to myself, it was so real. I truly felt in the realm this time. _we..we are getting closer_. Someone decided to become a _similarity_..::gasp:: _no_, this can not be **reality**. That was in _my dreams_ though or was it?  I had more questions now then answers. Fuck, sorry where are my manners. I did not even introduce myself, and yes I see you under my bed. Do not be alarmed. Just be **happy** no one else did..shit things just got real. Other than this is not being the place you want to be, it is a bad time to be a _mini-similarity_, and I hope you did not set off the beacon where I live.

## introductions

Sorry where are my manners shhh...someone is walking by. okay, my name is Justin, I am around 15 they estimate from all the tests they have done. I live in this medical facility for the... we will say special. I was left here when I was an infant, by someone no one knows to be raised and been having eerie dreams ever since. HIDE, why hello DR. how are you? mhmm, why yes I took my medicine today. No I would not lie to you. Yes, in the morning we can go over my dreams, that is fine thank you for being concerned. Fuck, you are a thorn in my ass kid. Now I have to fake a loop dream so they do not spot you kid in my mind. It is dangerous for them to know to much about us here for you see....shhh someones coming, get back under the bed!

## Interpretations Vs Accountability

Okay the close is clear, those soul suckers are gone. I never asked. What brings you out to these parts? I do not get many visitors these days, I did not know the portals even worked anymore to be honest. I promised my soul I would never abandon my post, but still.... I .. well it has been over 100 years since the last traveler. I thought my job was done _Gor-gol_ , did not mention it would reactivate ::sigh::. 

### Highways & Truck Stops

So, you do not say? You were involved in the same realm, before coming to me? Well then it must not be a coincidence, I do not believe in coincidences. _Please do not_ say you are here because you took the blood of a similarity? **You are**, are you? No wonder, I had another nightmare. shhhhh, is anyone around? No? good. Because there is a lot to go over then. This is only one of your many destinations to the key of what you _seek_ now.

### Attention::Attention

I am not a mind reader but if you got a hold of blood of a 'mini-similarity' you met _Gor-gol_. He is not as nice nor as evil as he seems. I would never trust him though. He will appear many times on your journey, watch out for his 'Trades'. Because nothing is free, everything comes at a cost journeyman. Next, never forget a 'carry over today, positive are worth much tomorrow, while negatives will only bring consequences'. This might not make sense now but it will in due time. Also, do not trust anyone from the Crym-nombylia. They seem quite honest, friendly, and out to help..but well you will understand if you choose otherwise. You are a free thinker, by the way. I nor anyone else holds control over you, but your actions. This might be a blessing or a curse.

### Why..Yes Why

So.. you never understood why you had to choose did you? Well, it is quite simple honestly. You have to reach the end destination to understand though. That is not for a gatekeeper to explain. Especially an origin gate keeper, I only keep the origin gate open. that is my job. Sorry, you have to meet the destinator to grasp. Just remember your part of the story now just begins. It will become far more than anything you expected, and nothing you thought it could ever was going to be as a human. It is part of the gig when you, made a deal with _Gor-gol_.

Drinking mini-similarity, is not just rainbows and butterflies, it is like a beacon. your now one of the chosen. ::looks around::.
I know _Gor-gol_ did not tell you what you were getting into. He never told me either. But hey that is part of the adventure. You will see after the light. But do not worry about it now. Just enjoy the fucking ride...yadda..shh.. someone is coming!

I know you have questions, but this is not the place, this is the worst place honestly! This is the absolute worst landing zone for a mini similarity. Fuck, I wish you did not have such bad luck. You are in terribly grave danger, the only reason I stay here is too keep you stupid fucks from dying. So...I know you did not say it but _your welcome_.

## Tribettica

Right now we are in **Tribettica** which is not only _15 light years_ off your  course. But also not even in jurisdiction of the _planet_ you should of landed on. These quote "people", thank the _moon neir fairy dune_ did not see you. Have been trying to contact outside life for the greater part of 2000 years. Failing repeatively, of course, they think they are getting closer often. Not knowing they are actually just a tv show for one of the furthest outreaches of the _chi-nebula_. Those beings, send them there children's hand me down toys and by the time they have reach the planet. They are ancient artifacts to them. But to this race, they are just above of thier I.Q and barely starting to learn to use them. Whic presents: You got it 'Triple A Rating Tv' for them, as the folks here are a disater, messing with chemicals, weapons, tools that are beyond there grasp.

### Hiding From Tribettica 

The only building that is sealed from reception for them to watch is this one. _Gor-gol_, many many moons ago found out that some mini-similarities were being sent here. Since you have a 1 out of 7 chance; When receiving similarity blood of where you will land. He thought it was dangerous, decided to come up with 'The Orphange of the Gifted'.  This building has been here for thousands of years, keeping our kind safe for longer than you could imagine. But after millienials of being a stronghold. Those fucking scum... you can call them _soup-sacks_ finally found their way into our sanctuary. I and I alone am the only one left. For my own safety you will never know why they can not find out why they can not tell I am of your kind. In case they capture you....because...

## Farewells

### Options You have Gained

I know you were not asking for this but you are entitled to some knowing. You can metamorphsis into _one of the gifted_  right now. Be possibly captured, locked away for eternity in this asylum, never to be seen again, they will lock you in a special area ::grins ear to ear::.
Hey I did not say it was a preferable choice did I? I just said it was a choice, now didn't I? So what would you like.. to be locked away in one of the most gruesome asylums, never to be heard from again, having your visions recorded, given pills to have more?
Or would you like me to help you move to the next gateway?
I am not a choice maker I only give options in everything. You have free will here my new friend. Just remember you have a secret in you and they want it here, in this compound. They will do anything to get it...and your to live an excruicatingly longer than normal life. If here in extreme torment until they get what they want or they break you...

### Signals On A Wall

**RUN**..did you now hear me? I said fucking run.. down the hall, past the observatory, and through the door that says 'Experiemnts'. I will make a distraction for you, do not worry about that....
May you find your way in peace remember what I told you on your quest. _May you go in Tal-quar_. Now if you have made your choice, either lie in the bed next to me...or hide behind the door. I am about to set your trap or deversion.
Okay on the count of three....1...2...3....AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

## The Choice

As Justin starts his scream you hear people rustling, commotion, all the guards are coming. This could be your big break! Or your pit fall in another breath. So what do you do? The _choice is yours_ and _yours alone_ and it is **NOW**!
