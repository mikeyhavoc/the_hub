              <p>In plain this is a mind dump. Covering vast spans of thoughts, ideas, dreams, and stories. If it pops up in my head? It might appear. If it sounds like its been played a few times or in a sci-fi movie or anywhere else full of popular culture? It might appear. If it casts doubt on life, existence, or the universe? it might appear. Everything else... is fair play too.</p>

            <p>
                I prefer this sphere, over all others for a writing space. No other is as free, or as open as the github landscape.
                Anything goes, and freedom of creation feels more real in this landscape than any other. So I prefer to call this my home for my Story Corner.

               The stories, tales, and thoughts within are makings of the mind. No one was hurt. Some are remakes, some are remixes, some are puns, and none should be taken seriously. The mind is only as dangerous as you let it be. With that said, if you enjoy what comes about.. follow if you enjoy.

            <p>Leveraging the jekyll doc theme I sped up the build process for my blog. and going to my github you can too. As I progressively enhance it, I hope to make to it a better product than I left it. <a href="https://github.com/mikeyhavoc/the_hub">github repos</a>.</p>
