# Count Down

> ... We count down as we wait for the mighty selector moving through the sky.

## The Amazonians

Lost among technology, far away far away are the Amazonians. They are a resilient yet supersticous group. The Amazonians have never ventured outside of there territory nor believe it is safe too. Being delivered a quest by there god the click not wanting to anger it they live to please the click. But this is not how it always was.....

### Amazonian beginnings

Back long, long ago days now the Amazonian historians believe they started out in one small village. This sole village is where the Amazonians all came from. They believe life was simple back then because they did not have the advancements they created or what the mighty click was ready to reveal to them.
As they started to find these archeological finds further in time. They started to also, dig into there history. These archeological digs, made it evident the Amazonians knew life existed outside of their realm even when they were a small village. They also, found out they were originally trading paper that was grouped together. The Amazonians never went into further hunt of what they traded...

### Archeological Meltdown

In the records, a note says "Stop digging you will end cizilization!"<br>
in the records recorded the last data record that can be looked up reports.
>log 2001-12-31 As we started to excavate in the far end of border of Tara the lost lands. As we were pushing cobwebs away we found red lights everywhere and many ports broken. The very last port that said "last resort" was still green, something we have not come across at any excavation site before! Meanwhile another team found the hub controller room for all the ports. Some stayed back at the port and two others and myself went to the control room. Ransacking the control room we found an auxillary power source that still worked amazingly. Next we found 3 data keys and 2 crypto keys. as we inserted the crypto key on the mic we heard screaming! something? or someone was screaming some kind of undiscernible noise from the port! As we turned on a viewing screen, it was too late!! **Something** was pulling our other teammates in with its 6 arms into the green lit port! 

> supplemental log, we turned off the energy source. we lost two men though. we have four books from this control room 2 crypto keys and 4 data files to analyze later. As we rushed out to help our comrad he was delirious screaming beware of _slogops_!! My team mate says he saw unspeakable things from dimensions a plenty. The _sloglops_ want to bring over and invade our dimension with. To keep the _slogops_ out of this dimension we have sent the crypto keys to.... 

'end transmission' <br>

### Questions

Wondering about the _slogops_ and what happened to the other part of the team I quickly copied all data I possibly could from the archives. Before anyone caught onto what I was doing. For it is forbidden to take data out of the archives in Amazonia.
I got the data about all the archeological digs, the cursed dig, info on the missing data file and keys, the missing team memebers, and the tiny shred of data about the unrecord author.
