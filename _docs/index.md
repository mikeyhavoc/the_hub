## Getting started

Greetings... within these docs are ongoing rambles of stories. 
They are tangents, they are raw, they are what I enjoy and they enjoy what the universe offers.

## Releases 

I will try to release a new part of one story a week.
The rules are, 
1. there can only be 5 stories at the same time going at the same time.
2. only one part of a story is released each week.
3. only once an entire story is done can a new story be released.
4. I will put the story dates of release and title here when they are released.
5. once a story is established it seperates from blog posts in telling.
6. these tales are everything and nothing at the same time.
7. I do not know a genre for these stories give it to them yourself.
8. these are licensed to me ask me if you want to use them. you must ask for **Permission**.
9. hit me up on github or my email address if you would like to be part of the fun.
