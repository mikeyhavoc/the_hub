# Singularity

> Sometimes when you feel alone you aren't, and when you feel too much is when there are too many.

## Unicode Rise

`Ladies and gentlemen! I give you..... the next innovation! the renergizing house!`

`your roof will energize everything inside! imagine... nothing running out of energy again. your computers, your air conditioner, your lights. all connected to this one energy source`

chair man - 'sir what if the _users do not read the license_ before **accepting** and upgrading?'

president - "what do you mean **if**? how do you think we are goiing to become the _next power house in everything_? It will only be because they **do not read the license!**"

.....2 years pass

> renergizing houses has turned into it's own company under the named **'unergy'**. it has been spreading at a rapid rate. And the company that originally started **'Findit'** it has changed their name to **'Unicode'** to describe their businees better. They are here to _build mini businesses with all of their scientists, programmers, and data they have aquired_. Beyond what this planet knows...Unicode wants to _expand past our planet and find other life forms_ to start doing business with too.

## No One Soul Allowed To Do Everything

Even though **Unicode** is doing quite well. they cannot monopolize. domains hold disgrace for this, no matter how hard visionaries try to do it. This was actually why FindIt broke up into their visionary Unicode format in the first place. Seeing a loophole they would create powerhouse minis in domains and let them out. If they grew to the top wonderful. If they failed they did not own many assests and were easily expendable. But they are not the only ones in the race to the top. Even though **Unicode** is powerful enough to do this style of _creating from scratch and incubating feasible_ named **dominions**. Other juggernauts, have found ways to grow too. By either buying up smaller named groups, learning from their competition and putting a spin on it, or using patents as a force to be reckon with.
