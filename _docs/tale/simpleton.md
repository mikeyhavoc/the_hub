# The Legends

> What if you were in control, but not in control. What if someone controlled what controlled what controlled the next level and someone controlled that level and beyond?

## Particles and Fairy Dust

What are you made of? This might come up someday, lots of answers are possible. Energy, protons, atoms, and the occasional fairy dust with mini me's powering larger me's running  larger me's. What you do not know of the self powering mini folk called '_mini similarities_'?

## Join The Realm

On the outside you have no idea someone is a _mini similarity_, they are just like you and me. This is further from the truth though, they are abstracts of nature I promise! These creatures look like you and they speak like you even! But they are nothing like you. Mini similarities, are the most complex creatures in the **chi-plex**. Yet you have seen one, be amazed! You, yes mere human beings might be cross contaminated with a mini similarity. **You lucky spec of earth compost**. Hey, I never said it truly was a bad thing...._did I_?

You now belong! Welcome, to being _worth something_ more than just a meat bag. Or you know, another artifact for another alien race to dig up when your dead for an archaeological dig site. Hey you are now awesome to the **WHOLE** alien race even! Sad, human being do not know the complexity of the _galaxy_ let alone what place they have it compared to a mini similarity and everyone else in the galaxy do they... Ahh, I got it now.. no one has ever told you? **Damn** Sorry to rip the freaking _band-aid off_. Oh well, it can not undone, might as well enjoy, **cheers** to _unknown-beings_.

## Drink Your Poison

Now you might be saying, to yourself something that possibly goes along these lines...
> "mini similarities don't exist...humans are the most powerful beings in the universe you ark-nard!!"
Well, wake the fuck up you three-dimensional, single-cored, air-breathing, _ark-nard loving_, failure to reach another life form. You already destroyed your own planet...Yes _I went there_. So you can drink your own poison now that were pals ::grins::..hey buddy, I am just looking out for your best interest here honest. Right, that is what is called I believe on your planet. So I will put the choice up to you now. There is two directions you prick your hand with 'mini similarities' blood. Or you can join the 'quays-nar cult'....so...buddy...pal...What will it be XD :] I know your an adventurous person, besides you only die once...or do you? haha only one way to tell for real. Am I right or am I right?
